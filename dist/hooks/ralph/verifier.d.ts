/**
 * Ralph Verifier
 *
 * Adds architect verification to ralph completion claims.
 * When ralph outputs a completion promise, instead of immediately
 * accepting it, we trigger an architect verification phase.
 *
 * Flow:
 * 1. Ralph outputs <promise>TASK_COMPLETE</promise>
 * 2. System detects this and enters verification mode
 * 3. Architect agent is invoked to verify the work
 * 4. If architect approves -> truly complete
 * 5. If architect finds flaws -> continue ralph with architect feedback
