# Brainless - AI Workforce Orchestration

**Intelligent, self-assembling AI agent teams with memory and escalation protocols.**

---

## What is Brainless?

Brainless is a production-ready AI workforce orchestration system that dynamically assembles specialist agent teams, learns from experience, and resolves issues internally before escalating to users.

### Key Features

🤖 **Dynamic Team Assembly**
- AI analyzes your task and recommends specialist agents
- 29 named agents with unique personalities (Vikram, Elena, Maya, Alex...)
- Memory-informed selection based on past successful patterns

🧠 **Continuous Learning**
- Every task is captured in memory
- Future teams benefit from historical patterns
- Agents are instructed to consult project history

🚨 **Smart Escalation Protocol**
- 3-tier internal problem-solving before user involvement
- Routes issues to appropriate specialists (Design→Architect, Security→Architect, Scope→BA)
- Only escalates to users when truly necessary

✨ **Delightful UX**
- Witty runtime messages ("🚀 Summoning the cavalry")
- Clear team introductions with rationale
- Confidence scores and data source transparency

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
npm install -g @brainless-brilliant/brainless
```

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Run with team assembly
brainless "Build OAuth2 authentication with security audit"
```

**Output**:
```
🎯 Building your dream team (or at least a functional one)

👥 Team of 3 assembled:
   🏗️ **Vikram** (Principal Architect)
   🔒 **Elena** (Security Lead)
   ⚙️ **Alex** (Senior Engineer)

💡 Security audit + architecture design needed
📊 Confidence: 85% | Sources: haiku + memory

✨ Your team is ready! Coordinator will now orchestrate their work.

## The 29 Specialists

### Architecture & Design
- **Vikram** (Principal Architect) - Design decisions, refactoring
- **Priya** (Senior Architect) - Pragmatic analysis
- **Rohan** (Junior Architect) - Quick questions

### Security
- **Elena** (Security Lead) - Full security audits
- **Sam** (Security Analyst) - Quick scans

### Implementation
- **Jordan** (Staff Engineer) - Complex multi-file work
- **Alex** (Senior Engineer) - Standard implementation
- **Taylor** (Engineer) - Simple tasks

### Quality Assurance
- **Maya** (QA Lead) - Comprehensive testing
- **Oliver** (TDD Evangelist) - Test-driven development
- **Sophia** (Code Quality Lead) - Code reviews

### Build & Fix
- **Marcus** (Build Engineer) - TypeScript/build errors
- **Katie** (Build Intern) - Quick fixes

... and 17 more specialists across research, design, planning, and data analysis.

## Configuration

### Optional: Haiku API Key (Improves Recommendations)

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-...
```

Without API key, the system falls back to keyword-based classification (still functional).

### Debug Mode

```bash
export AVK_DEBUG=true
```

## Features in Detail

### 1. Runtime Team Assembly

Every task triggers intelligent team selection:
- **AI Analysis**: Haiku classifier recommends agents
- **Memory Search**: Finds similar past tasks
- **Capability Matching**: Safety net fallback

### 2. Agent Escalation

6 escalation types with smart routing:
- `question` → Coordinator (PM)
- `blocker` → Coordinator (PM)
- `design-decision` → Architect
- `security-concern` → Architect (escalates to user after 1 attempt)
- `scope-change` → Business Analyst
- `approval-needed` → User (immediate)

### 3. Memory Layer

Selective memory capture:
- ✅ Executor/specialist work
- ✅ Implementations, audits, fixes
- ❌ PM orchestration (excluded to reduce noise)

### 4. Agent Personalities

Each agent has:
- Human name
- Job title
- Personality trait
- Witty introduction

Example: **Elena** (Security Lead) - "Assuming everything is a SQL injection"

## Credits & Inspiration

Brainless is built on the foundation of [oh-my-claudecode](https://github.com/cyanheads/oh-my-claudecode) (originally `sisyphus`). We're deeply grateful for their pioneering work in agentic coding systems.

**What we added**:
- Dynamic team assembly with AI classification
- 29 named agent personas
- Escalation protocol with internal resolution
- Memory layer integration (inspired by [claude-mem](https://github.com/yourusername/claude-mem))
- Continuous learning from task history

While the core architecture originated from oh-my-claudecode, the abstractions we introduced (runtime teams, escalation, memory influence) represent a fundamental evolution of the orchestration model.

## Architecture Highlights

### Modular Prompt System
Agents receive contextual prompt modules based on task requirements:
- Core identity
- Delegation rules
- Security guidelines
- Memory access
- Testing guidance

### Haiku Classification Engine
- Fast, cheap task analysis
- Boolean capability flags
- Team recommendations
- Confidence scoring
- Caching layer for performance

### Team Builder
Three-stage selection:
1. Haiku recommendations (primary)
2. Memory insights (augmentation)
3. Capability fallback (safety net)
