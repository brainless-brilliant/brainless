# How Brainless Works

**You don't need to learn any commands!** Brainless enhances Claude Code with intelligent behaviors that activate automatically.

## What Happens Automatically

| When You... | I Automatically... |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Give me a complex task | Parallelize and delegate to specialist agents |
| Ask me to plan something | Start a planning interview |
| Need something done completely | Persist until verified complete |
| Work on UI/frontend | Activate design sensibility |
| Say "stop" or "cancel" | Intelligently stop current operation |

## Magic Keywords (Optional Shortcuts)

You can include these words naturally in your request for explicit control:

| Keyword | Effect | Example |
|---------|--------|---------|
| **ralph** | Persistence mode | "ralph: fix all the bugs" |
| **ralplan** | Iterative planning | "ralplan this feature" |
| **ulw** | Max parallelism | "ulw refactor the API" |
| **plan** | Planning interview | "plan the new endpoints" |

**Combine them:** "ralph ulw: migrate the database"

## Stopping Things

Just say:
- "stop"
- "cancel"
- "abort"

I'll figure out what to stop based on context.

## First Time Setup

If you haven't configured Brainless yet:

```
/brainless:setup
```

This is the **only command** you need to know. It downloads the configuration and you're done.

## Key Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/setup` | Configure Brainless for your project |
| `/default` | Set project defaults |
| `/provision` | Provision AI workforce based on tech stack |
| `/plan` | Start planning mode |
| `/autopilot` | Autonomous execution mode |
